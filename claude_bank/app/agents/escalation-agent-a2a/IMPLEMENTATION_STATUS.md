# Escalation Agent - Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 5, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ Core functionality working, Email integration ready

---

## What's Working ✅

### 1. Ticket Viewing (get_tickets)
- ✅ Agent receives "Show me my tickets"  
- ✅ Agent calls `get_tickets` MCP tool directly
- ✅ Agent displays tickets (or "no open tickets")
- ✅ **NO spam emails sent**
- ✅ Customer ID automatically used from context

**Test Result**:
```
User: "Show me my tickets"
Agent: "You currently have no open tickets in the system..."
```

### 2. MCP Server Updated
- ✅ Added `ticket_service.py` with ticket management
- ✅ Added 5 new MCP tools:
  - `get_tickets` - View customer's tickets
  - `create_ticket` - Create ticket + send email confirmation
  - `get_ticket_details` - Get full ticket info with history
  - `update_ticket` - Update status/priority/notes
  - `close_ticket` - Close resolved ticket
- ✅ Email tools still available: `send_email`, `send_ticket_notification`
- ✅ Total: 7 MCP tools registered

### 3. Agent Instructions Updated
- ✅ Clear rule: "NEVER use send_email directly"
- ✅ Emphasizes: "Customer ID is ALWAYS provided"
- ✅ Instructions prioritize `get_tickets` for viewing
- ✅ Instructions explain `create_ticket` sends automatic email

### 4. Architecture
- ✅ Standalone agent pattern (like UC1)
- ✅ Direct MCP tool control
- ✅ Full A2A protocol compliance
- ✅ No Foundry dependency (Foundry agent created but not used)

## Integration Points 🔗

### Current Integration

**Escalation Agent** (UC4):
- Port: 9006
- MCP: http://localhost:8078/mcp (Escalation Comms)
- Tools: get_tickets, create_ticket, update_ticket, close_ticket, get_ticket_details
- Direct user queries: ✅ Working

### Required Integration (Next Steps)

**ProdInfoFAQ Agent** (UC2) → **Escalation Agent**:
```
User: "Do you offer student loans?"
ProdInfoFAQ: "I don't have info about that. Create ticket?"
User: "Yes"
ProdInfoFAQ: [Should call Escalation Agent via A2A]
Escalation Agent: [Calls create_ticket MCP tool]
MCP Server: [Creates ticket + sends email confirmation]
```

**AIMoneyCoach Agent** (UC3) → **Escalation Agent**:
```
User: "I need help with investment portfolio"
AIMoneyCoach: "This requires specialist help. Create ticket?"
User: "Yes"
AIMoneyCoach: [Should call Escalation Agent via A2A]
Escalation Agent: [Calls create_ticket MCP tool]
MCP Server: [Creates ticket + sends email confirmation]
```

## Email Flow 📧

### Current Behavior (Correct ✅)

**Viewing Tickets**:
- User → Escalation Agent: "Show my tickets"
- Agent calls `get_tickets` MCP tool
- **NO email sent** (just viewing data)

**Creating Ticket**:
- User → Escalation Agent: "Create ticket for credit card issue"
- Agent asks for confirmation
- User: "Yes"
- Agent calls `create_ticket(customer_id, description, priority, customer_email, customer_name)`
- MCP server creates ticket in database
- MCP server automatically calls `send_ticket_notification()` internally
- **ONE formatted email sent** (like your screenshot with ticket ID, details, etc.)

### Email Template

The `create_ticket` tool sends email using `send_ticket_notification`:
```
Subject: BankX Support Ticket

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for contacting BankX support. We have created a support ticket for your inquiry.

Ticket Details
--------------
Ticket ID: TKT-2026-000001
Category: Credit Card Inquiry
Your Question: [Description]

Our specialist team will review your query and respond within 24 hours.
You will receive an email notification when we have an update.

Best regards,
BankX Support Team
```

## Testing Status 🧪

### ✅ Completed Tests

1. **Agent Card**: ✅ Pass - Returns EscalationAgent v1.0.0
2. **View Empty Tickets**: ✅ Pass - "You currently have no open tickets"
3. **No Spam Emails**: ✅ Pass - Agent doesn't send emails asking for customer_id

### ⏳ Pending Tests

4. **Create Ticket**: Needs A2A call from ProdInfoFAQ/AIMoneyCoach with customer email
5. **View Created Ticket**: After ticket creation, verify it appears in list
6. **Update Ticket**: Test status change and notes
7. **Close Ticket**: Test ticket closure
8. **Email Confirmation**: Verify email received at purohitabhinav2001@gmail.com

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Update ProdInfoFAQ to Call Escalation Agent ⏳

**File**: `app/agents/prodinfo-faq-agent-a2a/agent_handler.py`

**Current**: ProdInfoFAQ has Escalation MCP tool connection but calls `send_ticket_notification` directly

**Needed**: ProdInfoFAQ should call Escalation Agent via A2A:
```python
# When user confirms ticket creation
escalation_response = await httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:9006/a2a/invoke",
    json={
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Create high priority ticket: {issue_description}. Customer email: {user_mail}, Customer name: {customer_name}"}
        ],
        "customer_id": customer_id,
        "thread_id": thread_id
    }
)
```

### 2. Update AIMoneyCoach to Call Escalation Agent ⏳

**File**: `app/agents/ai-money-coach-agent-a2a/agent_handler.py`

Same pattern as ProdInfoFAQ - call Escalation Agent via A2A instead of using MCP directly

### 3. Test Complete Flow ⏳

```
User → ProdInfoFAQ → "Do you offer student loans?"
ProdInfoFAQ → "No info. Create ticket?"
User → "Yes"
ProdInfoFAQ → Escalation Agent (A2A)
Escalation Agent → create_ticket MCP tool
MCP Server → Create ticket + Send email
✅ User receives ONE formatted email with ticket details
```

### 4. Add Customer Context to Escalation Agent ⏳

Currently `agent_handler.py` doesn't receive `user_mail` parameter. Add it:

```python
async def get_agent(
    self,
    thread_id: str,
    customer_id: str,
    current_date_time: str,
    user_mail: str = None,  # ADD THIS
    customer_name: str = None,  # ADD THIS
) -> ChatAgent:
```

Then pass to instructions as context variable.

## Architecture Decision Rationale

**Why Standalone Agent?**
- Foundry agent kept asking for customer_id despite it being in context
- UC1 agents (Account/Transaction/Payment) work perfectly with standalone pattern
- Escalation needs precise MCP tool control, not RAG/file_search
- Direct MCP routing ensures correct tool selection

**Why A2A Compliant?**
- ProdInfoFAQ and AIMoneyCoach need to call Escalation agent
- A2A protocol standard for agent-to-agent communication
- Maintains consistency across all 6 agents (UC1-UC4)

**Email Strategy**:
- No manual `send_email` calls by agent
- `create_ticket` MCP tool automatically sends confirmation email
- One email per ticket creation (not multiple emails)
- Email contains full ticket details (ID, category, description, timeline)
